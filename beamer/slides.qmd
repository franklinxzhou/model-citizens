## Introduction

**Business Context**  
Subrogation is a critical part of the claim lifecycle. When a third party is liable, recovery reduces net incurred loss, improves loss ratios, and enhances reserving accuracy—making subrogation a key financial and loss-mitigation lever.

**The Core Challenge**  
Current subrogation identification relies heavily on adjuster judgment and manual file review. This process is slow, inconsistent, and often results in missed recovery opportunities across thousands of claims.


## Subrogation Modeling Framework

**Our Mission**  
Build a predictive model using 2020–2021 first-party physical damage claims to flag potential subrogation opportunities, identify key indicators, and provide recommendations for operational use.

**Modeling Objective**  
Predict a binary outcome *Subrogation Opportunity*  
(1 = likely recovery, 0 = not likely).  
Evaluation Metric: \textcolor{red}{F1 score} (balances precision and recall due to asymmetric business costs).

**Business Value**
\begin{itemize}
  \item[$\bullet$] Improve recovery rates and reduce net incurred losses  
  \item[$\bullet$] Help subrogation specialists prioritize high-value cases  
  \item[$\bullet$] Reduce time spent on low-likelihood opportunities  
  \item[$\bullet$] Support data-driven decision-making in the claims process  
\end{itemize}

**Dataset Summary**  
- Training data: 18,000 rows with subrogation indicator (0/1)  
- Test data: 12,000 rows without the indicator  
- Features include policyholder, driver, vehicle, accident details, and estimated payout  

**Data Quality Steps**  
- Removed 2 rows with missing subrogation indicator  
- Removed 1 row with all values missing  
- Test dataset contains no NAs  
- Dropped `vehicle_made_year` (post-claim dates → impossible)  
- Excluded `age_of_vehicle` (unreliable reporting)

## Why We Used Multiple Preprocessing Pipelines?
\footnotesize

Each model family has its own optimized pipeline, in accordance with their algorithm characteristics.
